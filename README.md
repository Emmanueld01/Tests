# 🚀 EmmaTask: Professional Task and Schedule Organizer

EmmaTask is a web application designed to help users manage both long-term tasks and daily agendas efficiently. Built using foundational web technologies, this project demonstrates core JavaScript proficiency, DOM manipulation, and data persistence.

## ✨ Key Features

* **General To-Do List:** Manage tasks that don't have a specific date (long-term goals, study topics, etc.).
* **Weekly Schedule:** Dynamically generated view of the next 7 days, allowing specific task assignment for each day.
* **Data Persistence:** All tasks (General and Daily) are saved locally in the browser using **localStorage**. Tasks remain intact upon page refresh.
* **CRUD Operations:** Full functionality to **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate (Mark as Completed), and **D**elete tasks.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized layout for both desktop and mobile screens using CSS Flexbox and Grid.
